I think that the problem probably does have a lot to do with the frequency of the hits.  When I smoked my last analog a week ago today, I timed just how long it actually took to finish it, just smoking casually and not trying to break any speed records.  I also counted the number of normal drags it took.  It took me seven minutes and ten drags to finish it.  Since I started direct dripping, I've found that two drops directly on the atty will last close to ten hits, so when I get that slightly burnt taste, I add two more drops and put the 510 down for a while.  I had been vaping so much that it was like chain smoking.  My throat is a little better now, but even if the problem persists, it still beats smoking analogs.     ....Pam",

Keep in mind that some of those products you mention also contain PG. I also found out that onions or any variety of plant in the onion family (chives, garlic, etc.) can cause a serious form of anemia that can be fatal as well. That's why it's important not to feed cats ""people food"". Even baby food has garlic powder in it that can be harmful to kitties.",

The forums are usually slower on Saturday so that's probably why nobody as posted in the new forum yet 

Anyway, a manufactured cigarette actually contains about 10mg of nicotine, but only one or two milligrams is actually inhaled by the smoker.

Let's break it down, in this case we will say the user is puffing on a 901...

Average inhale time

3 seconds

Volume of inhale

0.4-0.6L

'Air' Flow

10 litres / minute

Approx. puffs / day

200 (10 puffs per cig. x 20 cigs)

Approx. puffs / ml

2.5 ml is like 20 cigs. 10 puffs per cig so 200 puff / 2.5 ml

So about 75 puff / ml

Approx. drops / ml
20 drops / ml

Approx puffs / drop
3-4 puffs per drop

Approx ml / puff

About 0.015 ml per puff

ml the mesh can hold
A standard (901) atty's mesh can hold about 6 drops

That's about 0.2 ml

ml / dripping top-up

People will top-up when mesh is between half and fully depleted,

and add about 3-5 drops;

about 0.1-0.2 ml

Dripping top-ups / day

15-25

ml / cart

901, 501 : 0.5 ml

301 : 0.3 ml

801 : 1 ml

Cart refills / day

A 901 cart holds about 0.5ml. Will need refilling after about 0.25-0.4 ml is used

So about 7-12 times / day (each refilling being about 2 cigs equivalent of vaping)

Puffs / cart

About 50

Volume of inhale

0.05 - 0.1L. 

A 'lung inhale' rather than 'mouth inhale' would be 0.05-0.1L through the PV followed by a further 0.1-0.3L of air.

Lung capacity.

Total capacity of lungs: 5 - 6L; of which about 1.5L always remains inside after maximal exhale.
When deep breathing, volume of inhale and exhale can be something like 2-3L.
Normal breathing turns over about 5-10% of the air in the lungs: 0.25 - 0.5L. 

Battery capacity.

Manufacturers are likely to provide a figure closer to total capacity than usable capacity (and that depends on current drain and pattern of use etc.). Not all the capacity can be used.
I'd say it is reasonable to knock off a third of the stated capacity to get a truer real-life usable figure for vaping.

'Mini' (510, 901) battery capacity.

So taking our 150 mAh battery and applying some reality will give us more like 100 mAh.

Life of a 'mini' battery between charges

Current will be over 1A (initially), let's call it 1A. So about 6 mins (360 sec.s).
5 second puffs: 75 puffs.
3 second puffs (more common): 120 puffs.
Even these figures are 'at best' ones, assuming a new battery. 1A+ is somewhat over-spec for this size of battery, so will not last as long as expected (though this depends a bit on how much 'recovery time' the battery has between activations); the battery will really be struggling, get warm etc. 
So, real figures are more likely to be 
5 second puffs: 50
3 second puffs: 80
between recharges. About 1/2 a pack of analogs equivalent. So the average person will need at least two batteries per day and use about 30 drops (1.5ml) per battery. A very light 'smoker' might get by on one.

There is such a shortage of qualified medical staff in the country that it borders on frightening.

I've seen this so many times where management just never thinks things through. It's a stupid idea and, unfortunately, the patients will pay for the lack of proper staff at the hospital.
I do agree with GDub. It's a little known fact that a business has the right to impose any type of discrimination they want in the hiring practice as long as it is not race, sex, nationality, or religion based. I can set up my company so it's against policy to hire any males who have mustaches and there is absolutely nothing the law can say about it.
But there is so much short sightedness and stupidity in management, it boggles the mind. This hospital administrator VP, Pope, is just one example of such idiots. It brings to mind a situation when I worked for IBM in the early 80s. Some mid-level manager decided that it would be a great idea to implement manditory drug testing (read that pot testing). He got all these kudos and bonuses. Then they starting testing and realized they would have to fire 90% of all their engineers! Needless to say, that policy was dropped like a hot potato!",

I don't know the studies that you have been looking at, but from what I have read the single worst thing about nicotine is that it is highly addictive and the second worst thing is that it does tend to reduce body weight, which is why pregnant women must not smoke or vape or risk low fetal birth weights. Yes, at very high doses nicotine can be toxic, but so can many things.  

Beyond those things, scientifically, nicotine doesn't seem to have many other negative side effects.  Nicotine doesn't cause cancer or heart attacks.

However, having said all of that, no one really wants to be ""an addict"", climbing walls if they can't vape or smoke.  So there are good reasons to step down nicotine to zero, but it appears that the benefits for doing this are more psychological than purely physiological.



Thank you, Kmel, for your response to this topic. I'm sure all of us are interested in how things effect us and, like I said before, its important to educate ourselves on this stuff.

I must say that I've had a difficult time finding current, up to date reports of nicotine use that isn't linked in some way to tobacco abuse. The findings I've been most interested in, and feel are the most pertinent, are those that concern Nicotine Replacement Therapies (NRTs). And I'm finding that those reports are somewhat ""worded"" to convince the reader that NRTs are safe, and much healthier than using tobacco. Please note that most of those studies are done by the same companies that make and profit from the NRTs.

I have to admit that some of my opinions about NRTs come from my experience as a nursing professional. I have also talked with my doctor about the ecig. In my postings I have mentioned that pregnant and nursing mothers should not use nicotine. This is not only my opinion but also the opinion of my physician. And NRTs have a warning on the box that tells moms to consult with thier doctors before using the product. NRTs, or nicotine, has been linked to sudden infant death syndrome, I'm afraid to say. Pre-mature birth, birth defects, and low birth rates can be a result as well. 

Now, in my posting I wrote, ""what about the rest of us""? And I wrote that I was still searching for answers on that. I haven't found very much, dear. Your absolutely correct about nicotine not being connected to cancer. I have watched all the interviews on youtube with physicians stating that nicotine, by itself, is not harmful. Even my own doctor has told me that he would much rather me use the ecig than smoke tobacco. 

When I wrote about possible overdose I was trying to explain (rather poorly, I think) that it is basically IMPOSSIBLE to OD while vaping. You would have to drink a bottle of juice in order to die. And that is why I wrote about the concern I have over the eliquid getting into the hands of toddlers or very small children.

After starting this topic, I started another topic called ""Why we choose to vape"". I went into more detail about the safe use of nicotine there.

I really don't have a lot of concerns about nicotine, Kmel. Yes, it is extremely addictive. It is said to be more addictive than heroine. And because of the way it effects neuro-receptors in the brain, the demand for more nicotine increases over time. Which is why everyone ends up smoking more and more the longer they do it. Nicotine is primarily a stimulant. It is known to increase heart rates,  and it can increase blood pressure. Because I happen to have high blood pressure this was a concern for me. But when I mentioned this to my doctor he said that the other chemicals found in tobacco are far worse for my blood pressure and that he felt that I was much safer using an NRT (like the ecig) than continuing with tobacco. 

Addiction concerns are normally viewed as being bad because most addictions have some adverse effect on a person's life or well being. But if it doesn't hurt us in some way is it still bad for us? I think your statement that it's more of a psychologiacal question than a physiological one is very correct. Each person must weigh that decision on thier own. The important thing for me is knowing that I'll be able to enjoy vaping for a hell of a lot longer than I would ever be able to enjoy using tobacco....

Good morning all.  Today starts day 3 of my vaping adventure and I am very, very pleased.  This morning however I did notice one thing and I am not sure if it is the vaping or just the natural healing process from quiting the analog's.  When I take a drag from my 510 I get a quick almost painful burn in my throat, almost like it is raw or burned.  That said, I have some alergy issues at the moment along with a chough caused by analogs that is going away, but may be making my throat raw.  I guess I am just curious from the long time vapor's out there, if you vape alot, can you feel it in your throat or lungs?  Overall how do you feel after a month or so of kicking the analogs and going vape full time?  

One other note, I am vaping more than I smoked, I used to only smoke evenings and weekends, but I am vaping at work now during the day.  That said, I still think drag for drag I am taking less pulls now than with analogs.  Well, I look forward to reading your responses, thanks for the help.

Cheers,

Drink plenty of water, maybe slow it up a little as well?  What level of nicotine are you at?  I stuck to my regimen of going outside, waiting an hour to vape but went nuts on weekends while drinking.  I definitely had a sore throat for a little bit but don't want to have you ignore yours because I had one.  If you are a weekend only smoker, I would recommend zero nicotine or very low nicotine as it sounds like you aren't really addicted.

Also, have you tried a different atty in case there's something actually wrong?

thought I would give a follow up to a post I made on here that I had planned on letting my Dr in on my vaping and the details of my experience well I told him and he brought in to other Dr.'s to view this new Green smoke as he called (had a big laugh in that one) and they all were amazed in knowing I was one that had gone through the books on quitting they were all in arms over that I was able to stop analogs in the first day I vaped and never looked back that it took the crave and withdrawal smtoms and threw them out the window not only that I have medical news to show that vaping assists in health improvements 6 months ago I had a chest x-ray and it showed serious signs of damage due to my smoking they had me do one and I will again in july on my next check up but this latest one had showed side by side there was clearing out of the dark color that was staining my lungs as well my nreathing tests showed I had a larger exhale mas than on a previous test done so keep vaping keep getting healthier and live longer so we can kick the FDA in the butt I asked if he would be wiling to send my results to the FDA with a letter stating my improvements I guess I should have stopped while I had him in a good mood that simply didn't fly well

Shrugs and sighs 
oh well someday they will see
Peace and Vape on !!

If you dont mind sharing this info with the UK proposed ban issue it would be great.They need hard evidence from doctors showing the benefits to people who use PV's.

I left my opinion and if you havnt this would help alot.",

Even if they try to use the argument that children will be targeted, which they WONT, but SO WHAT. Its friggin HARMLESS, and actually beneficial. Its really starting to scare me, because the more logical it seems to ALLOW the sale of e cigs, the more Im sure the Govt. will lower the boom. Logic and legislation are NEVER used in the same sentance. Thanks again Comp, and this article is priceless for our cause.


Your Welcome keenan! I found it in my search for PG and it's effects on health.  Gives new meaning to second hand vapor?  Made me think that's for sure. Like you I was a smoker for many years and had the constant colds and flu like systems... This is my first winter Vaping and have had way less trouble with cold and flu like systems this year than in years past. I think everyone should be adding this study link into letters and emails they send to Senators and others.

The only thing I might add to what's gone before, is to consider liquid with a VG component. Vegetable Glycerin creates a lot more vapor and is easier on the throat hit. One thing to keep in mind is that is also can tend to reduce the flavor -- but just a bit, and not really that noticeable. I've taken to using a lot more VG in my juice, and I like it quite a lot.

Since I haven't read your earlier posts, can you repeat for me what device you're using? Just curious. If you're using voltage higher than 3.7V, I would strongly recommend more VG, perhaps 50% or greater. Just my experience, not sure it would apply to others.

And because you're thinking of vaping 0 nic, making your own liquid would be a very simple and economical approach. Check out the DIY Liquid forum for lots of great info. I'd be happy to share what little experience I have in that area too if you have any questions. I'm pretty much making all of my own liquid now and am quite satisfied after having done a lot of experimenting.

I really enjoyed smoking, and now I have substituted the smoking for vaping. Even with me vaping a 24mg juice and doing it quite frequent because I love vaping, I can't explain how much of a huge difference it has made with me as opposed to smoking. I feel like a million bucks compared to hackin up all that crap every morning. I am definetly using less nic now. The first 2 weeks of vaping, I detoxed from cigs hardcore. I was constantly sweating even when it was 75 degrees, which is not normal for me. I took more than one shower a day sometimes because I was sweating so much sht/toxins out. With all the detox going on, I still did not have a desire to light up. In fact, during those 2 weeks I did light up because I still had a half pack. And I only lit up twice. Both of those times I lit up, I took one drag, and put it out. I didn't like it at all. Thats when I knew for sure I didn't want or need to smoke anymore. Last week I tried to ease up on the vape to see if I would jonez for a vape like I would a cig in the past. For me it wasn't like I had to try at all. I really dont think I am getting nearly as much nic as I was before with the 1 1/5 to 2 packs a day, although I'm still tryin to figure that one out. Maybe its just me, but after trying this, I think I could go with a really low dose nic juice, and then jump to nic free pretty easy now. I'm thinking its possible to even just stop all together. But everyone is different. For now though, I like nicotine and really love vaping. So I'll go ahead and do similar to your guys plan or just straight quit when I really want to. After my experiment vaping less for a minute, I think for me it's a whole lot easier to drop the nicotine now with vaping then before with cigs. What else were we addicted to that was in cigarettes though? After my experiences so far, I sincerely believe the chemical addiction with cigarettes is more than just nicotine. I know nicotine is obviously the major and main cause/culprit for the addiction, but I don't think it was the only chemical causing the need for cigs. I'm not talking about psychological dependence either, which is a whole other thing in itself. I'm gonna skip the proof read and spell check here, so I apologize if this post has crappy grammer. Peace all, and Vape On!

If you notice the blood is dark and seems to becoming from the top end of your nose (closest to your eyes) this can be a sign of high blood pressure. 

For now however I'd suggest exhaling through your mouth and drinking lots and lots of fluids. (Good fluids IE water)

Hardwired, while you're waiting for the new juice, you could go to the pharmacy, or a place that sells baking supplies like a wally-mart, and try to find some VG to add on your own.  Look for stuff that says usg 99% glycerin. (Grab an eyedropper if the bottle doesn't have a drip cap!) Obviously, mixing equal parts with your 24mg juice will give you 12mg strength.  You'll lose some flavor, but you'll have something to vape and you can see if the headaches go away.  Good luck and welcome to Vapor Talk!

Decades before the e cigarette was invented, a study was conducted by Dr. Robertson of the University of Chicago's Billings Hospital in 1942 on inhalation of vaporized propylene glycol in laboratory mice. A more in-depth article was printed in the 1942 issue of TIME Magazine for November 16th. ""Dr. Robertson placed groups of mice in a chamber and sprayed its air first with propylene glycol, then with influenza virus. All the mice lived. Then he sprayed the chamber with virus alone. All the mice died.""

Exactly.

I agree fully... I can go a whole day without vaping if I wanted to (and I have a few times) and not really be phased by it too much (usually I don't like to vape when I'm hung over as hell)... but when I smoked cigarettes, when extremely hung over, I hated to smoke but felt I absolutely needed it even if it made me feel worse (which it does)

as for my odor detection, a.k.a (nose) , it is more keen atm , ive smelled a tree that grows outside my home that i never new created a light fragrance. my wife would tell me about it every spring lol she'd say,""you cant smell that awful smell that tree is giving out?"" lol i do smell it now its a faint wet dog smell , not a good smell but not something i'd go grab the chainsaw for lol. other then that i think im cured .

VG produces more vapor and less TH and perhaps flavor, while PG gives great TH and flavor and can dry out your mouth and throat when you vape a lot of it.

Because I vape 6V, PG was too harsh for me and the flavor tended to taste somewhat 'burned.' So in my DIY I started moving towards more VG and a higher proportion of flavor. This still gives decent TH because I'm a high-nic guy, produces clouds of lovely vapor, and delivers good flavor on top of it all. My mixes have 50-70% VG, usually with the only PG being what comes with the flavoring. This works for me and I think I've found my sweet spot at long last.",

Meanwhile, there's plenty of good stuff to try out. I'll see what I can come up with in terms of what flavors I like from which vendors for starters. Here's the e-liquid list from Perfumer's Apprentice -- good flavors for the most part, some not quite strong enough for my lack of tastebuds but that's probably a personal issue. More later.

Thats funny you brought up the hungover part. After a hardcore night of partying till the early hours (It's been a couple years or more since I've tied one on that bad), I would dread lighting up because I was hungover and feeling like major ***. I was one of the ones, out of my boys, that would eventually light up after raiding the pickle jar and whatever else in the fridge that I thought might help in the hangover curing process. A full night of partying like that, I'm guessing I would smoke at least 2 1/2 packs, a pack or so more than normal. I would only smoke not more than a few cigs because my lungs were cashed feeling, and I felt like major sht. As nasty as the thought of a cigarette was at that point, I still had to smoke even though I knew it would make me feel even more sick.",

So, I had about 3ml of 24 mg juice all over my hands. At first it was just on one hand but I was wiping to on my pants and rubbing my hands together. I wasn't even thinking about it going though my skin. I was just concerned about it drying. What I did probably made it worse because I rubbed it in and spread it across my hands to make it dry which put it on more of the surface of my skin. As I was sitting there I started having this nervous anxious creepy feeling. It was so out of the ordinary that I knew it was the juice right away. I got up to go to the restroom which is right next to my room. From the time sitting right here at my computer to the restroom sink I went from creepy feeling to all my veins are tense to,""OMG! My left arm! I know what that means!!!!"" I washed off my hands faster than I ever have before!

If something like that happens to any of you then go straight to the sink. Also, don't buy an E-dobit. I only used my E-dobit for one day. It isn't much different from a plastic pen. I could see it breaking in my pocket and spilling all over me. The danger isn't worth it.",

I know what you're talking about, but I've only had one in the almost six months I've been vaping.  So, for me anyway, I'd say vaping isn't causing any for me.  I also got some of the blue foam to try and have been using that for a couple of weeks now, so I don't think it's a problem for me either.  But to be honest, I've never figured out what my triggers are for migraines.  Okay, except for bright light or flashing lights.  I know they can both do it, but bright light doesn't always do it.  Flashing lights do most of the time.  And I do have migraines other times that I have no clue what brought it on.  As far as the ocular migraines, I don't get them very often at all any more, but I've never really known what brought them on either.  And I've never had them like you are this week.  I don't know that this is any help to you, but I sure do hope you find out it had nothing to do with vaping at all.

And most of all, I hope you get well really soon.

So to take some care, usually your next to a sink or a paper towel.  If it makes you nervous just clean off the liquid, and assess your condition.  If you feel faint, or dizzy, try to sit down and relax without VAPING.  the last thing you need at that point is more nicotine",

For me initially I had the sore throat, occasional heartburn, stuffy nose, headache, very tired and felt very scattered, difficulty sleeping.  that was almost 6 months ago--the bulk of those symptoms were tobacco related. My cough is nonexistent, not near as short of breath (can actually make it up a flight of stairs without sounding like I just ran the mile), taste has improved, smell has definately improved and I don't stink.

If the coughing and stuffy nose doesn't improve in the next week or so--you may want to consider a sensitivity (allergy type) to one or more flavors.  I have read several accounts on the forums about those symptoms being related to certain flavor additives (different people, different flavors) and or PG vs VG.  in each case they were able to identify the culprit and continue happily vaping symptom free.

Not to sound insensitive or rude, but as adults and parents we do need to show some responsibility for our actions. We shouldn't leave bleach or antifeeze out around where children can get in to it. And we should keep matches and alcohol out of reach of children too. Well how is nicotine different? We should clean up after our mess and keep our children safe. What I don't need or want is a nanny state where the FDA or any one tries to tell me what i can or can't do. How much is too much nicotine or caffeine. As an adult I take full responsibilities for my actions. In return I know I should be careful to protect children and wildlife.

I simply object to filtering my thoughts, strangling my free speech, and chipping away at my freedom. 


Love the reply lol! I do hear where you are coming from-I just thought I would post it as an FYI because even though I consider myself and intelligent, educated and responsible adult I make mistakes (as I am sure you do as well) and yes-I am responsible for my mistakes, but considering they are so easy to make-I honestly would not have thought that any of the e-liquid would have remained after I wiped it with a towel, let alone be transferred onto a spoon that set there for a minute.

I always have baby wipes with me when I am filling and messing with juice, so if I spill I can get it up right away and there is no way that it is going to still be there.

The other thing you might want to be careful about is calling it ""JUICE"" in front of the kids.  Call it nicotine liquid or niquid or whatever don't let them thin its juice.

Its a little strange, but the gum stimulates you into salivating more, which helped me a lot with my dry mouth and throat. It comes in a mouthwash, a toothpaste, a gum, a spray and a gel. 

I have a window shopping problem...and I originally bought the gum because I thought it was hilarious that it makes you salivate more. But when it helped my smoker's dry throat I decided it wasn't so hilarious anymore XD

Good morning all.  Today starts day 3 of my vaping adventure and I am very, very pleased.  This morning however I did notice one thing and I am not sure if it is the vaping or just the natural healing process from quiting the analog's.  When I take a drag from my 510 I get a quick almost painful burn in my throat, almost like it is raw or burned.  That said, I have some alergy issues at the moment along with a chough caused by analogs that is going away, but may be making my throat raw.  I guess I am just curious from the long time vapor's out there, if you vape alot, can you feel it in your throat or lungs?  Overall how do you feel after a month or so of kicking the analogs and going vape full time?  

One other note, I am vaping more than I smoked, I used to only smoke evenings and weekends, but I am vaping at work now during the day.  That said, I still think drag for drag I am taking less pulls now than with analogs.  Well, I look forward to reading your responses, thanks for the help.

Cheers,



Congrats on day 3 
Since you are vaping a lot, your throat could be getting irritated with the vapor. You may want to scale back on the vaping a little. Its not fun to vape if it hurts.
After kicking the analog habit I feel sooo much better. I have much more energy, I don't get sinus headaches all the time like I used to, and I can breathe better.  I hope the same for you.",

So, is the claim, due to nicotine or any of the other thousands of chemicals in cigarettes. Lets face it chronically ingesting any foreign chemical into your body, whether it be nicotine, caffeine, alcohol, smog or nuclear waste can't be good for long term health....

And don't forget to add ""clothes"" to that list !  I don't know how many jackets and shirts I've had get those little pesky ash holes when I was smoking and the wind took effect!  Thank goodness I found vaping.

I can't believe an MD would say something like that!  
Number 1, the flu (and cold for that matter) are a virus. The reason you get over a flu or cold is that your body develops anti-bodies to the virus. The virus is still in your body and will be there until you die and maybe even a good while after that!
Number 2, nicotine will kill damn near anything, including you. A virus wouldn't stand a chance against even a low concentration of nic. Plus, as it was mentioned, PG is a potentent anti-germacide.
So what's really happening is that your are having a relapse because your immune system is just having a tough time dealing with this particular virus. You may also be getting secondary infections because your immune system is trying to fight off the virus instead of killing bacteria. Basically, it sounds like you are really run-down.
Like I said, I'm not an MD doctor but from experience you could try beta glucan (from the health food store), vitamin C (dissolve it in some VG and vape it), lots of water, and rest, rest, rest.
And the reason we don't like to vape when we are sick is because the PG dries out your mucus membranes and makes you feel like crap.
Anyway, I'm not saying we shouldn't clean our carts. It's probably a good idea since God knows what type crap collects on them from the air, carpet, fingers, whatever. But as for you condition, I would put money on the fact it has nothing to do with the carts.
Hope this helps and get well soon!",

So I pulled a joye 510 out of my purse and showed him and explained it and even vaped in the exam room.
He says..oh, that's like a nicatrol (sp) inhaler. He said I have no problem with that, they sell nicotine over the counter, after all. Just don't smoke and use it, he said. I'm his quinea pig!

Happy New Year to all. Lazy me hasn't gone to the gym since I started vaping (almost 30 days, YIKES! ) Anyhows, my first exercise I do is the life cycle and I was hoping to see my heart rate drop tremendously. Unfortunately it was right back to the same rate as when I smoked analogs. Maybe it's just the fact that I haven't worked out in so long? Anybody else workout and did you see a decrease in heart rate once switching to vaping (I normally go to the gym 4- 5 times a week)

Sadly , I'm hoping that now that I'm going to vaping it will get my lazy *** into the dam gym. Let alone.  ROFL.  But I cant imagine that as you get back into your workouts that you will see a benefit. Most Definitely.

I am about 2 weeks already now. Wow, times flies.  Theres something I noticed in the last 2 days. When I ordered my ecig kit, I requested VG liquid as I had read that it's the better vapor and such. Well, I got a bottle of flavor last week and I used it for more than a day. I like the taste very much but I started to get a feeling in my throat that made me feel I had to clear it all the time. I also was jittery and didn't feel like I was getting the nic I needed. I didn't put my finger on what was going on right away. I just knew that something was wrong and it was the first time I craved an analog. (I didn't have one though) I went back to my first bottle of liquid that I started with and within a day, this all stopped. I'm thinking the new bottle was PG based. Can someone be allergic to PG? Has anyone experienced this before? 

Also, without sounding gross, did others cough up ""stuff"" a week or so after quitting analogs. Do our lungs try to clean themselves out?

Thanks 


That clearing of the throat was EXACTLY how I was feeling when I first started trying to vape.  It was suggested to me to try the VG also, which I finally was able to do, but in the meantime for a few weeks I kept smoking the PG, and for me the throat yuckiness eventually got better.  I don't think that was an allergy for me (I don't really have allergic reactions to anything) so much as I just needed to get used to it.  I tried the VG for the first time last night and felt really ""funny"" afterwards, so I think it's all just a matter of adjustment and preference.",

A bonus to PG, is that it is that it kills bacteria(according to some literature) and would possibly decrease your risk of contracting airborne illnesses.  Also once you stop smoking after 7-10yrs your risk factors associated with smoking drop down to that of a non-smoker.
Personally I liked the PG-VG mix I received from Wordupecig.


That's why I also get the 50/50 mix from Wordup. I get the best of both worlds and don't have any of the pure PG side effects.",

If your using an unmodified 510 and the battery fails it will blow out the LED and vent forward.

Unfortunately these ridiculous super mod's are not designed by electrical engineers and don't take into account the possibility of battery failure and provide proper forward venting.

Protected batteries can stop overcharging and undervolting, but cannot do a thing about an internal chemical short. An internal chemical short will instantaneously cause massive overheating and the pressure will blow out the ends of the battery. This pressure must be able to escape the housing of the device or BOOM.

You can take a firecracker and put into your open palm and receive a burn, but close your fingers around it and you won't have to worry about using those fingers ever again.

Electrical Engineer Replying.

P.S. As pretty as they are I have no desire to purchase a PV Mod. I like my 510 (and my teeth).

P.P.S. I am not belittling the unfortunate victim, just telling ""ROOR"" not be to concerned about the 510.",

Vaping around a pregnant women is tricky.  I do not see the harm in it as the ingredients in e-liquid (minus the nicotine) should have no effect on anyone around you.

That link is EXTREMELY informative. Thank you very much for posting/re-posting it here. I hope that any attorny that happens to support our cause now, or in the future, will have this type of ammo when he goes up against the FDA....

One thing that I would like to point out about PG,VG, and all the glychol stuff is this.

The FDA has been quoted as saying that they found traces of Dyethaline Glychol (DEG) in one cartridge sample that they've tested. This compound (according to the FDA) is apparently found in anti-freeze. Now, I don't know crap about anti-freeze, but I do know that I haven't found a single supplier yet that boasts Dyethaline Glychol as being in thier e-liquid. Whether we should be leary of pre-filled cartridges is a mystery, as well.

And because the FDA refuses to publish both thier findings and thier testing methods, pending litigation, we're expected to just believe that what they've said is truth. Hell, the media has even reported these apparant findings without even questioning either the FDAs methods or motives.

BTW, I'm not anti-FDA. I completely understand that the FDA doesn't want to endorse something that may seem attractive to young people or that may  be harmful in some way. But I am FURIOUS about the tactics they're using to mis-inform our citizens about a product that has OBVIOUS health benefits over analog cigarettes!!

I'm no physician but my immediate response would be yes, it can absorb through your skin. However I seriously doubt you need to worry about over-dosing. It seems to me you would have to leave it on your skin for an extended period of time to really absorb a significant amount. I wash my hands when I get it on me because it leaves a slightly sticky residue which I find to be annoying, but I don't really worry abut the effects of absorption so much.

Hmmm... inquiring minds want to know.

I don't, but I'm sure there's somebody(USA) that does extract nicotine for other reasons such as patches and gum; and I take ""USA juice"" with a grain of salt but I have come across at least one supplier that claims 100% USA ""SOURCED"" ingredients and this is why I brought that up........nicotine extraction is not a DIY activity and there will be much more said about this subject by local and federal gov in the near future.

Thank you for being brave enough to share your story so that we can all learn from it.

I am so glad your little girl was ok.

I always have baby wipes with me when I am filling and messing with juice, so if I spill I can get it up right away and there is no way that it is going to still be there.

The other thing you might want to be careful about is calling it ""JUICE"" in front of the kids.  Call it nicotine liquid or niquid or whatever don't let them thin its juice.

Take care!


 Oh good info-see it's these little things that we may not think of. I don't believe I have discussed the liquid with the children at all, directly, but perhaps with my husband and they are such little sponges!! If I change my terminology now it will become a habbit and I will be less likely to slip. Good tip-thanks",

The friend mmseng was talking about it was me. I was handling this stuff without really thinking about it, and would definitely agree with mmseng's idea of a posted safety notice.

I had vaped lightly three times on this specific day over several hours. I was refilling and got maybe two drops on my fingers, a drop on my hand, and a couple or so on my arm. I didn't think anything of it and wiped it all off on my pants. It only took about three minutes for me to realize something was wrong. Symptoms included a feeling of coldness in the extremities, extreme muscle tension all over to the point of shaking a bit, underarm sweat and clammy hands, slight headache, and most of all I was extremely hyper and anxious. Seemed to last 4+ hours.

I was positive it was the liquid, but just to be sure I preformed a pseudo-scientific experiment consisting of dropping three drops of the 24mg/ml solution onto my inner wrist and rubbing. This effect was the same and much more intense. It took effect in about 30 seconds rather than three minutes and I was forced to wash it off.

I have smoked heavily for the last 4 years and am quite used to nicotine, but this was something else.

Point is, this stuff should be handled with care.",

I want you to first take a look at this video that shows the tar you get from only 2 cartons of cigarettes, which can take only 2-3 months to consume out of the years of smoking.





Had that experiment been done with e-liquid vapor, the water could have stayed crystal clear for weeks, heck maybe even months. Compare that to your lungs; your not getting any of the carcinogens, tar, or the 4,000 other chemicals you get from cigarettes.

I also want to point out that quality USA made e-liquid only contains propylene glycol (safe for consumption as stated by the FDA), vegetable glycerin (also safe for consumption as stated by the FDA), some flavoring, and of course nicotine.

Although it's true that vaping may not be greatest thing for you, it is definitely better than smoking cigarettes, and it surely won't kill you! I cannot wait until 40 years from now when there are people out there saying they've been vaping for over 40 years and are in perfect health!

Keep on vaping!",

I live in Colorado and the air is already dry so the furnace is also drying out the air. I found that running a room humidifier has helped with the stuffy nose and coughing. So I guess what I am recommending is that you try a humidifier at night while you sleep. You may also want to try leaving the bedroom door open, if you usually leave it closed, at night to let the air circulate better. Good luck, I hope it get better for you.

I've gone 2 days without a migraine, this is good.  I have jury duty tomorrow, so I probably won't resume vaping til that is over.

I'm thinking this bout of migraines is NOT related to the vaping, but I'll start back slow and see.  It's allergy season, and I have all the classic signs of a pinched nerve, so I'm hoping it isn't the vaping.

Some interesting notes since I cut the vaping though.  

When you start smoking initially it's a slow process, you gradually increase your intake.  When you GO BACK to smoking, it's not.  

You know when you have an analog after vaping - even if you are vaping 0 nicotine., you get lightheaded and all that.  I figured a day of smoking would probably set my body back to thinking it normal.

This is day 3, and every half a cig still gets me higher than a kite.  LOL  So the body is much more used to the lack of crap than I even thought it was.

So today I'm vaping 0 nic.  I've found when I smoke analogs, I crave them even when vaping for a while, so I figure with the 0 nic vaping I will at least keep myself from ODing on nicotine. 

The other reason is I'm interested in just how much my body wants that nicotine.  We've discussed this before, how much or how little smoking has to do with the nicotine.

I believe THAT is as individual as we are.  Obviously if the entire habit had to do with nicotine then all of us that had tried the patch would have been non smokers before we ever heard of ecigs.

So I am my own guinea pig. LOL.  If I do get a migraine then I'll try the VG and see, but I don't know why I would suddenly react after 3 months.  So one thing at a time.  With luck, it is my pinched nerve that caused it.

Anyway, that's my thoughts on the experience thus far.",

I'd say this is completely new to me. Do you exhale through your nose? If not, I don't think it's caused by vaping and if you do, I still don't think so.  Pretty scientific, eh? The reason I say this is that vapor is generally warm and humid, which doesn't seem like it would cause mucus membranes to dry out to the point they'd bleed. If you exhale through your nose perhaps it could be due to a sensitivity to PG. If so, you could try changing your method to see if the nose bleeds stop. If they don't stop, see a doctor. Really. 

Good luck!

A very belated Welcome to VT! As you can see, this is a great place. 

The only thing I might add to what's gone before, is to consider liquid with a VG component. Vegetable Glycerin creates a lot more vapor and is easier on the throat hit. One thing to keep in mind is that is also can tend to reduce the flavor -- but just a bit, and not really that noticeable. I've taken to using a lot more VG in my juice, and I like it quite a lot.

Since I haven't read your earlier posts, can you repeat for me what device you're using? Just curious. If you're using voltage higher than 3.7V, I would strongly recommend more VG, perhaps 50% or greater. Just my experience, not sure it would apply to others.

And because you're thinking of vaping 0 nic, making your own liquid would be a very simple and economical approach. Check out the DIY Liquid forum for lots of great info. I'd be happy to share what little experience I have in that area too if you have any questions. I'm pretty much making all of my own liquid now and am quite satisfied after having done a lot of experimenting. 

Good luck, have fun and Vape On!



Sorry this took so long, I did not see it went to page 2!  I'm new not only to vaping, but also to the forum's in general!  I am using the Joye 510 manual model.  I would be very interested in what you have to teach, I usualy am fine with the nic withdrawal so I really want to go nic free! I am vaping 555 right now and really like the sweet nutty flavor, I also sampled RY4 and almost got it but went with the 555.  I tried vanilla today, but it was just a little to sweet if that helps at all.  I have not tried any fruity flavors yet so I am not sure what I will think about them.  It's funny, 3 days ago I was all worried about it looking and tasting like an analog, now, I could care less, just give me good vapor and great flavor and I am happy as can be!",

Oh yes there are a zillion triggers, and then there's a root cause which folks may or may not ever figure out. 

However, I've had back muscle type problems for nearly a year.  From what I've been reading, it could actually ALSO be causing these migraine episodes.  The trigger can still be light ...etc... but the root cause could be the pinched nerve I've been dealing with forever.

Usually it gives me a stiff neck, or I get the oh so nice arm going numb when putting it in certain positions, etc.  

I might have to break down and go see the chiropractor.  I generally don't like going because their aim always seems to be to keep you coming back forever.  But sometimes an adjustment or two CAN help.  

I've been putting it off too long.  At the very least I get the old problem looked at and rule it out as the root of these brand spanking new migraines.

(wanders off grumbling bout doctors, chiropratctors and other ORS...)


Migrains are a strange beast!  All I know is that there is typically something else 'GOING ON' in the body that is the problem.  Find that, fix it, and I bet you would live a much better life... migraine free.  I hope you are able to pinpoint the problem here and fix it.  Living like that is not fun... I live with low back pain on a daily basis too, so I know what you mean.  I just refuse to let them FUSE my vertabrae together for fear I will have more problems.  I guess we have to decide for ourselves just how much we can live with before doing something drastic.  I'm just not a gamblin' man though.  I think you are wise to see if a simple lifestyle change will help you.  Good luck.",

Still this is a valid question and yes lot's of people including me will respond with their humble opinions.  As always in this forum no question goes unanswered -- as two cents is about all we have -- so you got my two cents worth.  Ultimately you just have to weight out the answers that you choose to agree with, and make your own decision.



My sister n law has COPD, is on O2 and is a decades long smoker. She says she wants to quit but just cant. I bought her a joy510 kit and lots of variety of juice a couple months ago. She has been vaping and says only smokes an analog 1 or 2 per day-compared to the normal pack a day. Still doing tons of damage but less then she was. Also,alot safer to vape with o2 in the home versus smoking.",

to help me. i pulled out my e-cigs and juices he had already heared about e-cigs and said he felt it was good if it stoped me from smoking but he was a little concered about the e-juice not knowing what was in it besides nic. anyways i told him about my breathing and nose bleeds he checked my lungs and said sound real good and as far as nose bleed he said to drink more water my nose was dry and skin so for me to hydrate and that is what i did and no nose bleed. he took some notes looking at the bottles of juice i think he was writeing the names down like vapor talk . he was real happy and i went home happy knowing my lungs sounded good .oh also the dizzyness he felt was because of me not drinking enough water and i beliveit cause after i came home and drank more water i felt good.",

Even if they try to use the argument that children will be targeted, which they WONT, but SO WHAT. Its friggin HARMLESS, and actually beneficial.

Hmmm Schizo i could be wrong but i think i read somewhere that it only takes 2 hours for the body to rid itself of nicotine.... so unless they plan on ambushing you at the door every morning with a list of hiree dates... even if this does work, it essentially can't.  My whole point of the post was just to bring it to everyones attention.  The more things that get dismissed or overlooked the more we're missing our opportunities.  Now days you have to read the fine print on everything anyone does, including the government. Our rights are slowly being taken away from us and half the time ""no one knew about it...""  LOL it brings to mind the most famous line in hitchhiker's guide to the universe: ""what do you mean you dont know about it? it was posted in the alpha centauri for 50 of your earth years... what do you mean you've never heard of the alpha centauri????"" ok so that last line was alittle off topic, but you get my point.



Hey MD, just thought I should make a clarification. 

Nicotine is quickly filtered from the body, thats true. 2 hours for someone with a high metabolism. But the bad news is that cotinine, which is a metabolite of nicotine, can be detected in the body for up to 10 days, depending on the individual. Thats what any tobacco drug test looks for. Even non-smokers have cotinine in their system, but nicotine use substantially increases the amount of this metabolite. So the short answer is a person would have to abstain from any nicotine ingestion for at least a week or so before their cotinine would drop to normal levels. Hope this helps....",

I'm all for the ""better safe than sorry"" method, but I doubt those wisps of vapor have anything significant in them. I'd make an uneducated guess that it's about the same or less than the nicotine in tomatoes and potatoes. The same thing goes for the cocaine in our tap water; it's such an incredibly minute amount that our bodies don't even register it.

After all, they have the means of answering all our questions, don't they?

I didn't want to quote the entire piece, but left the last part, ha ha ha.  I have a rant somewhere on the forums.  We all know nicotine is bad, I want to quit it.  Here's the plan (my plan).  Vape vape vape, but down from 24mg (probably started too high), to under 10 right now.  I think on our next vacation, I'll go to zero but still vaping the entire time.  Once the 6-12 days has passed that I've quit the physical addiction, I'll start on the mental addiction, the really tough one.  This is where people lose it, stop smoking for years, go to a party, middle of a divorce, bum a butt and BANG, addicted again. But now I need to commit to not vaping.  Should I fail and still need to do it?  Ooops, no nic and vaping once in a while.  So sad, too bad.  Best article I read from a health professional on this pointed out the act of smoking is, by definition, to breath in burning material.  Most would agree that is a bad thing.  Vaping what amounts to fog machine stuff while not proven to be safe, has to be safer than inhaling burning matter.  That is my opinion.

So I fully intend to have my 0mg juice and an ecig on me at all times. Go to a party, have a good time, vape and not even think about it the next day because I will not be addicted to nicotine.  It is the act of quitting nic, then taking a cigarette which has the addictive drug nicotine in it, that causes people to ""fail"".  The way to not fall into that trap is to vape with 0mg.",

Good find there Luke, thanks for sharing!  And another excellent point about drinking more water while vaping.

For me personally, I feel less cravings for water since I've switched to vaping (nothing like a burnt analog to dry out your mouth).  But I vape nearly all VG nowadays, so that may have something to do with it too.  I've heard lots of folks mention that VG feels more drying to their mouth/throat than PG, but to me it's completely the opposite.

I'm also glad to hear that PG itself is biodegradable.  Yet another substance that in itself doesn't cause concern.

That's a good question Mike. Maybe it should be advertised as mixed in th USA not made in the USA. Does anyone here know of a US manufacturer (not supplier) of pure nicotine base liquid? Don't you have to have a pharmaceutical liscense to extract and make pure grade nicotine?

I was handling this stuff without really thinking about it, and would definitely agree with mmseng's idea of a posted safety notice.

I had vaped lightly three times on this specific day over several hours. I was refilling and got maybe two drops on my fingers, a drop on my hand, and a couple or so on my arm. I didn't think anything of it and wiped it all off on my pants. It only took about three minutes for me to realize something was wrong. Symptoms included a feeling of coldness in the extremities, extreme muscle tension all over to the point of shaking a bit, underarm sweat and clammy hands, slight headache, and most of all I was extremely hyper and anxious. Seemed to last 4+ hours.

I was positive it was the liquid, but just to be sure I preformed a pseudo-scientific experiment consisting of dropping three drops of the 24mg/ml solution onto my inner wrist and rubbing. This effect was the same and much more intense. It took effect in about 30 seconds rather than three minutes and I was forced to wash it off.

I have smoked heavily for the last 4 years and am quite used to nicotine, but this was something else.

Point is, this stuff should be handled with care.",

BigXor really hit the nail on the head here. The one and only reason we decided to carry the VP units in the store was the safety. At the time nobody had really thought about it but us. We knew some day this would happen. Which is why we have never carried any other custom unit.

When Jeso first created the VP units he was one of the first mod creators to use protected batteries. He also designed the units to turn only 1 1/2 threads. So in the event that a user with a death wish decided to either A. Use none protected batteries or B. Mix and match charged and uncharged batteries, there would be room for the gas to go, in this case through the bottom of the unit. Now of course this wasn't advertised because some nut job would give it a try. Just because you have an air bag doesn't mean you should crash your car into a wall. 

It would scare the heck out of you but you'd probably be ok. Another issue is the way modders place the atomizer fitting into the unit, most press the fitting into the unit. What does this mean? It means it won't handle much pressure, when a battery heats and expends and finally blows, guess where the pressure goes? You got it, right out the atomizer fitting. In this case it was the BB. While out in New York we pulled out about 40 units and placed them on the table and the first thing was said was, well, these are all pipe bombs just waiting to blow. We couldn't believe nobody anticipated this issue. Of course those with the knowledge like Bogxor warned of this but nobody listened. 

In the VP units case the fitting is of a threaded design, not pressed into aluminum. 


@kato07 - Exploding wouldn't be an issue for the VP passthrough because it's a straight passthrough, there is no battery inside the unit.


So next time you decided to buy a unit because it's the ""new"" thing, make sure you keep in mind some of the saftey users. Ask the modder ""what have you done to make this safe"" any good suppliers or modder should give you direct answers about what they've done. We have answerd this question a few times. If they beat around the bush, ditch buying the unit, it's just not worth it.


TY for the great info Christopher, as a noooobie, I know less than nothing about these issues.

Also thanks to jeff for the initial post in the first place.  Is that redundant? lol Initial and First place? Probably. LOL

I'm no physician but my immediate response would be yes, it can absorb through your skin. However I seriously doubt you need to worry about over-dosing. It seems to me you would have to leave it on your skin for an extended period of time to really absorb a significant amount. I wash my hands when I get it on me because it leaves a slightly sticky residue which I find to be annoying, but I don't really worry abut the effects of absorption so much. Maybe I'm living in blissful ignorance, but I wouldn't stress it.


That's good to know. I know the absorption rate would take time and if you wash your hands it's not a problem. I guess. I'm not sure if water can wash away ""oil"" so easily without some soap etc.. I'm thinking here not arguing.
I'm trying to cut down the nicotine dosage.. step down dosages to where I'm vaping the 0 nicotine juice. So I don't want to feel like I'm getting nicotine from touching the juice unnecessarily.",

Thanks to everyone who replied with good suggestions and comments.  Everyone can rest easy, I saw my E.N.T. doc today because another issue developed yesterday after posting on the forum. I noticed a sizable bump under my tongue and some swelling under my chin (upper neck area).  I panicked, called his office and they had a cancellation for this AM and I was able to get in to be seen first thing this morning.  
The bump under my tongue is actually a stone in my salivary gland (the gland under the tongue between the chin and Adams apple).  He said salivary gland stones usually occur when saliva production is decreased which can also cause canker sores and why my inner lip is chapped (red).  Apparently this is very common and after Googling it later today I confirmed that.  He told me not to worry a thing about it.  His instructions were to drink lots of water, massage the neck/chin area and suck on sour candy.  Sour candy stimulates the salivary gland and with extra fluids and massage the stone should dissolve on its own. Moisture from drinking extra fluids (specifically water) will also help with the canker sores and chapped inner lip. 
He did ask if I was on any medications or anything that would cause me cotton or dry mouth.  Of course I told him about vaping & e-cigs and that I had notice my mouth does become dry at times while or after vaping.  He was familiar with e-cigs and was thrilled I had an alternative and had quit smoking ""those nasty tobacco cigarettes"" (in his words).  He had NO problem with me vaping. However, he did say it is important for me, especially, to keep my mouth extra hydrated. He also said the salivary gland stones take months to form and I have only been vaping approx 6-8 weeks. He said vaping e-cigs was NOT the cause of any of this going on in my mouth or the development of the stone.  
I know some of you were concerned and as I was and I hate to be so wordy but felt some of you would want the details. Its all good  


I'm so glad!!!!  I drink a lot of water while singing, and I have false teeth, so between the two I do okay.  I have butterscotch candies, didn't know about the sour.  But they do get the vape taste out of my mouth when I try a flavor I find ICKY",

Im gonna go off on a tangent here. I think humans are genetically programmed to have addictions. 


I think -- and it's also just my opinion -- that humans are genetically and psychologically programmed to have ""rituals"".  By rituals, I mean physical and mental actions that we repeat regularly that comfort us and make us feel good. 

Whether those rituals are coffee-drinking, smoking, praying, doing drugs, running everyday, cooking, etc is up to us.  But there is something psychologically satisfying to doing those things every day, including all the repetitive actions that lead up to them.

It's much the same reason that vaping satisfies smoker's urges more than something like nicorette or other forms of nicotine alone. The rituals are similar between vaping and smoking.

And that's just my take on it.",

For me personally, I feel less cravings for water since I've switched to vaping (nothing like a burnt analog to dry out your mouth).  But I vape nearly all VG nowadays, so that may have something to do with it too.  I've heard lots of folks mention that VG feels more drying to their mouth/throat than PG, but to me it's completely the opposite.

I'm also glad to hear that PG itself is biodegradable.  Yet another substance that in itself doesn't cause concern.

Thanks for that one Dave--some good flavors. 
I really like the flavour Art from Liberty flights--but many flavors out of stock. Flavour Art flavors are fairly strong, but I will have to give PA a try.  I love mixing.

Yeah, I like FA too kitsune and sure wish Liberty Flights would get tobacco flavors in again. There's another US supplier, but danged if I can remember it now. This almost makes it seem like it'd be worthwhile to buy from Italy; at least you'd have quantities of the flavors (or, flavours ) you like. 

Some PA flavors, naturally, are stronger than others, but they all are very clean-tasting, powerful without being so in-your-face as some, like Lorann's, are. (Yeah, I do use some Lorann flavors too.)",

""Propylene glycol, the primary ingredient in the electronic cigarette cartridge, may be a powerful deterrent against pneumonia, influenza, and other respiratory diseases when vaporized and inhaled according to a study by Dr. Oswald Hope Robertson. Decades before the e cigarette was invented, a study was conducted by Dr. Robertson of the University of Chicago's Billings Hospital in 1942 on inhalation of vaporized propylene glycol in laboratory mice. A more in-depth article was printed in the 1942 issue of TIME Magazine for November 16th. ""Dr. Robertson placed groups of mice in a chamber and sprayed its air first with propylene glycol, then with influenza virus. All the mice lived. Then he sprayed the chamber with virus alone. All the mice died.""

Exactly.

Check out this VT thread.



PG does act as a sterilizing agent.  The problem is it's inability to distinguish between good and bad bacterial and viral growth, so while it does help deter sickness, it can also make your body's natural defenses weaker as well.",

Yea I will stick with my 510 until i get the scratch together for a spade or a joker. 



There are some PV Mod's with safety vents designed into them. Personally I have had too many high energy storage components blow up near me while in design and testing phase, such as batteries and big electrolytic capacitors. 

High energy batteries are prone to failure far more than the little ones in the PV's. Having a couple of those big high energy batteries in my face is just too scary for me.

I speak of energy and not voltage. Energy = Power. Ohm's law states that (watts or power)=amps X voltage.

For example the standard 510 battery is 130mah. The typical resistance of the atty filament is 2.5 ohms.
So the 510 draws (I=E/R) 3.7v / 2.5ohm = 1.48amps, the battery is rated for .13amps so the atty draws 11.38 times greater amps than the batteries designed rating. That's 4.7 watts from a .42 watt battery

Anyway that is why the batteries discharge in 30-60 mins. I've discharged them in less than 15 mins chain vaping.

That's scary enough for me and I'm willing to risk it.

Vape On!",

So this new policy only effects new-hires? You mean that people who already work there are allowed to smoke? Sounds like a stupid idea then. How can they enforce it? 

I wonder if it has something to do with insurance benefits? I know that a lot of insurance companies are demanding higher premiums for smokers and it could be that the hospital doesn't want to be paying for medical treatment that are associated with smoking. They'll be banning fat people from working there next. 

Either way, I think Brian has a damn good point. If it's legal for adults to use tobacco, then I don't see how this isn't a form of discrimination.

Might as well ban people who use alcohol too",

No nothing really different except juice flavors. It's just like it was when I was smoking analogs. Wake up and start coughing and hacking for about 10 mins or so and then it finally goes away. A little gunk in my throat and nose and after sounding like I'm gonna die for about 10 mins it all clears up. Didn't know if anyone else went through this or not.

Must be old age like Jeff said. You know how us old farts are. 

If it were me I would go back to vaping something you had a lot of, then see what happens.  Second, does it feel like you are coughing stuff from your throat or from your chest? Is it colored or clear? Usually clear is allergy if its colored it could be a sinus infection.  Any other symptoms? When I have bad sinus issues I cough in the morning blow my nose then its all good until I go to bed again because of the sinus's dripping down the throat.",

My hubby's brother, in his 60's, recently had his back fixed and he's doing great!  (same degenerative problem).  He also has it in his knees and hips and when one surgery is over, he's in for another.  He wishes now that he wouldn't have waited so long for the procedures to begin.  He doesn't smoke, however he was a 2nd hand smoker for most of his life.  (wife, father, brother, in-laws, friends, son...  everyone smoked around him).  According to Doyle, he should be worse off than a smoker.  I'm surprised any of us are alive, to be honest... because we were all breathing 2nd hand smoke, plus smoking, and we all should have keeled over at age 20 if we go by the ""official"" reports.  Hopefully they are exaggerating the nicotine report as well, but I wouldn't take a chance on it.  Kit offered good advice, and I hope and pray it works swell for you.  Best of luck to you.

We shouldn't leave bleach or antifeeze out around where children can get in to it. And we should keep matches and alcohol out of reach of children too. Well how is nicotine different? We should clean up after our mess and keep our children safe. What I don't need or want is a nanny state where the FDA or any one tries to tell me what i can or can't do. How much is too much nicotine or caffeine. As an adult I take full responsibilities for my actions. In return I know I should be careful to protect children and wildlife.

I simply object to filtering my thoughts, strangling my free speech, and chipping away at my freedom.

I look at it like any kind of pre-employment drug test, if that company has a policy prohibiting drug use it's their right to enforce it. I've had jobs I had to pass drug tests for in the past, and at the time that meant making some choices for me. Ultimately if you want the job, be sure you can pass the test. Sorry, I know I may be standing by myself on this issue, but it's a pre-employment screening, while it is on the extreme side in my opinion I respect that company's right to enforce any policies they have on their staff. They may start missing out on qualified hires because of this policy, and ultimately they will suffer if that is the case.

Keep in mind that some of those products you mention also contain PG. I also found out that onions or any variety of plant in the onion family (chives, garlic, etc.) can cause a serious form of anemia that can be fatal as well. That's why it's important not to feed cats ""people food"". Even baby food has garlic powder in it that can be harmful to kitties.


For the dog owners. Onions are also toxic to dogs. 

Because the liquid we use has nicotine in it, I would suggest keeping it out of reach of all pets and children. This also goes for the parts of your e-cigs. My cat thinks the atomizers and mouth pieces are fun little toys.",

They would think your not competent to understand legal forms.

That is from previous experience about the testing. & Someone said they would not sign until they had a lawyer review it.
They told them that will be fine. And gave the person 1 week. 3 days later The denied his hiring.
I wish I would have understood paperwork better back then. As I screwed myself on a job before. Due to signing the form not understanding it completly... Lost my job due to a misdemeanor. But I signed the form allowing them to hold that against me.

But now that I'm older, and have to rely on a CPAP machine for my sleep apnea, the humidity the machine produces works so well in my favor; it keeps my nasal passages from drying out.  It's only during like the winter when the humidity is so low, and about half an hour after i take the mask off, i'll get a nose bleed from dry air.

I usually don't xhale through my nose, so i'm probably not getting dried out from that, but I can see how the PG will dry you out if you do blow it through your nose.  But, its vapor, shouldn't that in itself keep your nasal passages moist anyhow?",

Hello This is Jeffrey Founder of WordupEcig Super Store your One Stop E-cig Shop 
I can honestly tell you that after about 22 month of buying the chargers and batteries all of it from china that I have left the charger Plugged in for days at a time and i can honestly tell you that I have done that with every one of our kits charger Because before we will put any e-cig  on our  sit I personally use it for a week or two so the charger stays plugged in.
The worst thing I can say I have had happen is the button on the manual battery button has stay on with out my knowing and burnt out an atomizer 
But other than that you should be totally fine (do not plug it in to an extension cord the cord will get hot ) but the wall outlet is fine 
If you need any more questions answer you can call or email us 24/7

However, this time I do think nicotine does affect the blood flow to the bones and really can delay healing.  the blood supply to the bones is not like the blood supply to our heart or muscles.  The bones are more sensitive to decreases in circulation--and it has been proven that nicotine affects circulation. 
our spine surgeons don't even like to use nicotine patches, gum etc on their patients. 

I am  a spine nurse and see the good and the bad.  Sometimes spine surgery is the only way to help chronic pain, when everything else has failed.  If you follow all the directions before and after surgery you will have a great outcome.   
One hint--the less pain medication you take a couple weeks before surgery--the better the pain medication works after surgery. 

One of the advantages to vaping vs smoking--you can wean yourself to 0 nic and still be able to vape !!!",

The FDA studies where questionable at best. They claimed to have found 1 chemical (diethylene glycol) however it was in such extremely low quantities (we're talk micro grams here) that it's unlikely it would cause any effect on your body. With that said, even it if did indeed cause issues, common sense say one is better than 4,000 chemicals found in traditional tobacco. 

It's also important to keep in mind that this was found ONLY in Smoke Everywhere's cartridges, it was not found in NJOY or any other supplier for that matter. The press however has had a field day with this one small test result.

Find one needle, in one haystack, and now jumping into a haystack is dangerous.

The one and only reason we decided to carry the VP units in the store was the safety. At the time nobody had really thought about it but us. We knew some day this would happen. Which is why we have never carried any other custom unit.

When Jeso first created the VP units he was one of the first mod creators to use protected batteries. He also designed the units to turn only 1 1/2 threads. So in the event that a user with a death wish decided to either A. Use none protected batteries or B. Mix and match charged and uncharged batteries, there would be room for the gas to go, in this case through the bottom of the unit. Now of course this wasn't advertised because some nut job would give it a try. Just because you have an air bag doesn't mean you should crash your car into a wall. 

It would scare the heck out of you but you'd probably be ok. Another issue is the way modders place the atomizer fitting into the unit, most press the fitting into the unit. What does this mean? It means it won't handle much pressure, when a battery heats and expends and finally blows, guess where the pressure goes? You got it, right out the atomizer fitting. In this case it was the BB. While out in New York we pulled out about 40 units and placed them on the table and the first thing was said was, well, these are all pipe bombs just waiting to blow. We couldn't believe nobody anticipated this issue. Of course those with the knowledge like Bogxor warned of this but nobody listened. 

In the VP units case the fitting is of a threaded design, not pressed into aluminum. 


@kato07 - Exploding wouldn't be an issue for the VP passthrough because it's a straight passthrough, there is no battery inside the unit.


So next time you decided to buy a unit because it's the ""new"" thing, make sure you keep in mind some of the saftey users. Ask the modder ""what have you done to make this safe"" any good suppliers or modder should give you direct answers about what they've done. We have answerd this question a few times. If they beat around the bush, ditch buying the unit, it's just not worth it.",

The whole thread is pretty good.  I think at the time, my biggest challenges as I went to 0 was missing the throat hit.  But I'm menthol so spent a lot of time mixing different ones up and menthol kind of simulates a throat hit. Next challenge was finding juices, was tough at first, but now pretty prevalent. I posted this as my source of 0mg, many more available now like the rath juices...

by being diligent with you back precautions you can slow the chances of needing more surgery.  BLT--Bending, Lifting, Twisting. Low impact exercise--swimming, walking helps too. 
Compliance with therapy and recovery is one of the main reasons spine surgeries fail or need to be repeated.  Learn as much as you can about the recovery and tricks you can use (avoid the horror stories like the plague). 

as far as the nicotine goes--I know all of our spine surgeons are adamant about no nicotine to help with recovery.  As a nurse I can actually support this.  The pathophysiology of bones supports this.  the circulation to the bones is very, very sensitive--the bones don't use a lot of blood, so what blood they do get is very important.
Blaming every disease or problem on smoking or nicotine pisses me off--but occasionally, it may not be the cause, but it certainly doesn't help.

I haven't tried lower my nic yet--but I do find that using a bit of menthol in my flavors adds to the throat hit--this may help with lower the nic.  FT Joe and Nana both use 0 nic and may be able to help with this.

@BirdDog - That's pretty much what I do know with the carts I keep. I have a ritual of cleaning out carts whenever they've been sitting around too long.

@Brian - I highly recommend it, we are using re-usable items so it should follow the same sanitary conditions like our plates and utensils. Better safe then sorry. 

@Brandon - You nailed it exactly! It felt really depressing while I was sick for so long, felt like I couldn't do anything. Even sitting in front of the computer made me feel lightheaded and sick, not to mention the coughing fits. Just to be safe, I'd rinse the carts off.

@Seaspine - I vape PG, Actually, I heard the same thing, that's why I didn't think that the carts might have been germ infested... Depends on the situation I suppose on what exactly PG kills and the amount need to kill bacteria. Also, it could have just been a natural winter cold/flu thing, I got and the carts might have no been the one that gave it to me. Who knows, but all I know is, I got sick bad and PG didn't really help me out.  

@Uma T-tip is one I wanted to get! I'm pretty much trying to condition myself to treat my carts like I would with brushing my teeth or washing my face. Make it a routine of sorts. Just want to be more safe then sorry. Cause I wouldn't want to be that sick ever again!",

I was getting a little concerned by some of the coughing I was experiencing after a week or so after getting off the analogs.
But my coughing is NOTHING like what some of you are describing here. I'm feeling very fortunate in the minimal reactions I'm experiencing.
While on analogs, I literally had to go outside to clear my lungs from waaaay down deep. Have not had to do this after 2 weeks of no analogs.
I was thinking it may help others if they what other people are expeiencing in physical reactions.

Can't say for sure but,I think the vapor could irritate the lungs on a person with COPD and make them short of breath.I'm a nurse and recommend vaping to many of my smoking patients,however I don't think I would make that recommendation to a patient who's respratory function is so poor they require constant oxygen. I even tell those kind of patients to avoid any kind of strong odors or fumes,it doesn't take much exposure to anything that irritates the lungs to put them in the hospital for breathing problems.If they were still smoking I might consider vaping an option but if not no way.



I have to agree with Seaspine. Even if there is no nicotine, the vapor will be an irritant to already compromised lungs.",

OK, before I started vaping, my whole life I have NEVER been the type to worry about things like ""Am I eating right"", ""How many calories or carbs does this have"", ""Am I getting enough exercise"". Things like that I could really not be bothered with, cause I KNEW the answer would ultimately always be a big fat resounding ""NO, you idiot, yer gonna DIE"". And I had other things on my mind like ""Do we have enough money for food and bills"", ""Is the car gonna make it another week"", ""Do I have enough money for cigarettes and beer"". I guess I had the macho mentality going where I thought I was invincible. I ALWAYS figured, ""Hell, If they sell it, I can eat it< or drink it."" Then God decided to give me a polite nudge, and I had a heart attack. If youve never had a heart attack, let me tell you, theres just NO point in me explaining the pain, cause you wouldnt understand unless you've had one. Its kinda like your wife telling you about giving birth, she describes the pain, but all you hear is ""Blah, blah, blah, hurt like hell, blah, blah, you sonofabitch,blah,blah."" Lets just say, heart attacks friggin hurt. I wasnt too happy with God at this point, and I mustve let it show, because 2 weeks later I had another one. So I said to myself, ""self, I think he means business"". Being the stubborn mic that I am, I decided this time I had better listen to my wife and let her make me the healthier things I always avoided. Before i could really get that plan in motion, I had another one. This one was the most severe one. This was the one that the Doctor came into the room and gave me the look of, ""Look you idiot, I have patients that are actually TAKING my advice, I really dont have time for any more of this."" That kinda scared me, cause if your DR. isnt going to give you 100% because you're not giving 100%, your time is gonna run out. While in the hospital that time, I had a series of mini strokes. Again, no point in explaining. Now mind you, I was only 43 at the time. My mother died in 1967 at the age of 42.I didnt want my kids to grow up that way too. So for a little while, maybe a year, I watched out for myself a little. And I emphasize, A little. Before long, when enough time ran by and I didnt feel like I was in danger, I slipped back into my old ways. Mind you, throughout ALL of this, I NEVER gave up smoking. WASNT an option. I honestly thought the stress of trying to quit would DEFINITLY do me in. Then about a year and a half ago I was diagnosed with diabetes type 2. OK God, dont you have BIGGER fish to fry (bad metaphore intended). So for about a month or 2 I HAD to watch what I ate, and I got it under control. Now, I just took the long way around the block to get to this point - When I started vaping, and its only been about a month and a half now, I am CONSTANTLY watching what I eat, drink, try to get a little exercise ( and for me, using the scroll wheel on my mouse was exercize), just like a whole new awakening to things I NEVER would have done before. And its not because I was scared into it, or had the fear of God put in me, its because now I WANT to live better. Just getting back a little thing like lung capacity has started a domino effect and triggered something in my mind that makes me WANT to be healthier. Now, Im not running out and buying a treadmill or anything, but there IS a difference, and NOTHING the FDA or any Govt entity tells me is gonna change me back. I WILL break the law to do this if I have to. Anyway, that was quite the rant, so Ill take a break now.",

They shouldn't be ignored, but I know I had a sore throat, I was coughing but a productive cough and there were other things than came and went.  But again, don't ignore just in case.  I believe wordupecig carries VG juices anda 50/50 mix and there are so many more out there that do.  I like wordup because of the sample pack, 5 5ml bottles of juice for $21, and free shipping so you can really experiment.

I don't know the studies that you have been looking at, but from what I have read the single worst thing about nicotine is that it is highly addictive and the second worst thing is that it does tend to reduce body weight, which is why pregnant women must not smoke or vape or risk low fetal birth weights. Yes, at very high doses nicotine can be toxic, but so can many things.  

Beyond those things, scientifically, nicotine doesn't seem to have many other negative side effects.  Nicotine doesn't cause cancer or heart attacks.

However, having said all of that, no one really wants to be ""an addict"", climbing walls if they can't vape or smoke.  So there are good reasons to step down nicotine to zero, but it appears that the benefits for doing this are more psychological than purely physiological.",

After smoking over 2pks a day for more than 40 years and can finally say that I fell better than I have in a long long time.
I don't hack up my lungs every morning, my breathing is better, my taste buds are coming back, and both me and my surroundings smell a hell of a lot better than we have for many years.
Now I'm not saying that vaping is completely safe. Anytime you inhale something into your lungs it can be harmful (even the air we breath is unhealthy)
but compared to all the tar and other crap that I've put into my lungs over the years I'm feeling a lot safer with vaping.
You also have to take into consideration that the FDA is partially driven by the big tobacco companies that don't want e-cigs cutting into their money.
If you look at the percentage of people who have stopped using analogs by using e-cigs compared to the success rate of those ""approved"" methods you can see why those companies are wanting FDA involvement. And the wonder drug Chantrix has been linked to several deaths.
So before you jump on the FDA bandwagon please do some more research and give the e-cig some looking into.
You might find out your boyfriend is really on the right track to a better healthier life.
I'm sure there are others here that can tell you similar stories about their lives as well.

Organization's Efforts to Ban Devices 

Hi Dave - A little while back I was looking at the NY ban and ran across the NY chapter's site and posted it here.

As I surmised, I believe based on the Lung Association also pleading for people to not buy cigarettes on Native American reservations (no taxes), I'd guess they receive part of the tax money as funding to their organization.  So as goes with sin taxes (soda), and other taxes to help people avoid things, its obvious once an organization gets big enough, the last thing they want is for their charter to be satisfied.  The LA wants their tax money to stay alive, they actyually want people to smoke!!!!  NY state wants a soda tax, not for people to stop drinking soda, they want the money.  Shameful.",

Guess I have mixed emotions about this, but it still seems to me that if it's not illegal, then it's nobody's damn business what I do on my own time.

I'm in agreement with pretty much everything you folks have said. Honestly Brian, I don't think my life has anything to do with anyone else's. At least insofar as it's inside my own home. 

The fact is, prohibition does not work. Human beings are hardwired to enjoy consciousness adjustments; we've been doing it for 200,000 years and some ridiculous law isn't going to affect that at all, regardless how seriously it's enforced. The only thing prohibition does is create criminals where there weren't any before. Pure ignorance. 

But another thing humans are wired for is being judgmental. Too bad about that; it's only destructive. I believe in freedom - total freedom so long as that doesn't impose on someone else's physical welfare. And I practice that freedom.


As to the nicotine ban at this hospital; that's just silly. Many people have gotten so politically correct that they've left the planet. Living in a fantasy is not sustainable. Banning nicotine will, like everyone noted, only reduce the number of qualified employees. Nicotine itself is harmless in the concentrations humans use it, and every rational person understands that. I suspect this policy is doomed.",

There are far more harmful things taken in whan smoking a cigarette such as tar and carbon monoxide that really are the big factors in causing lung cancer,COPD and heart disease. while nicotine is still a toxin vaping is a far safer way to take it in. To quote Arno from Awsome Vapor nicotine is only 1/3rd of the addiction.Most of us will likley drop our nicotine levles as time goes on, It's just that our chosen way of doing it deals with the other 2/3rds of our addiction.The nicotine levle taken in by vaping is about even of that given

 by more ""accepted"" methods such as gum and patches,yet seems to be far more effective for many.For myself I hope to get down to 0 nic juice one day,even if I never make that goal I know I am living a far healther life by staying away from the old coffin nails.",

According to my sources (and wikipedia), the lethal dose of nicotine is about 40-60mg. If I understand correctly, e-juice nicotine strength ratings are in ""X-mg per ml"". There are approximately 20 drops in 1ml. If you do the math, going with 40mg as the lethal dose, that ends up being around:

- 133 drops at 6mg strength
- 44 drops at 18mg strength
- 33 drops at 24mg strength
- 22 drops at 36mg strength
- 16 drops at 48mg strength

So yes, depending on what strength e-juice you are using this stuff can be very dangerous, and extreme care should be taken when dealing with the juice. Remember those figures are based on THE LETHAL DOSE. You could easily suffer from severe symptoms of nicotine overdosing at lower levels, including high blood pressure, stress, and all the other nasty possibilities.

I would go so far as to say that the possibility of e-juice absorption through the skin has to be one of, if not the most dangerous aspects to vaping. I had no idea the stuff was so potent when absorbed like that. You have to remember you're probably not even getting 1 drop per heavy drag when you're actually inhaling it. I'm surprised and a little frightened that I didn't know any of this before starting to vape. I did some research before starting, but this doesn't seem to be widely known, or at least is not widely available information. It won't make me quit, but I have a new respect for the substances I'm dealing with and I think everyone should re-evaluate their preconceptions on e-juice. In fact I think the vaping community in general should take steps to ensure that this information is made much more readily available, especially to newbies. A dedicated thread on the dangers and proper handling of e-juice would be a great addition to the newbie materials, and a video explaining the facts would be ideal. Thoughts Chris and others?

Moral of the story is, always keep something around to wipe up your juice with, be it a simple handkerchief, or even better some cleaning wipes of some sort. And always know what you are dealing with.

EDIT: The above figures are, of course, assuming full absorption. Obviously you will not always absorb all of the e-juice that gets on you, especially if you wipe it off, hence my last statement. And as was already mentioned, absorption rates will depend on what part of the skin the e-juice comes into contact with. Still this is very pertinent information to all vapers, and ESPECIALLY those with kids and pets.

my take:

Although many of us believe that vaping is quite safe, it has never definitively been proven one way or the other. Even if there is a .01% chance of harm, that is far too great to expose to my family. I don't go outside but I do go to another room.

Imagine my horror when my 3 year old, who love star wars already (from his cousin) saw me on a VP/PT and was excited over my ""light saber""

Plus the fact that you're trying to quarantine yourself (which is great BTW, but doesn't help the fact that you're left alone to your misery) is a good thing, but something that most people can't do.  I sympathize.

Thanks for bringing up the point about cleaning your cartridges.  This was something I've been curious about lately as well, but haven't been able to find much info on it.  I'm down to my last 510 whistle tip, and have been using it for about the past 4-5 days.  Every site I look at is out of the whistle tips, and I just really can't stand the round ones.

My only 2 cents-- if the atty gets too hot, it can actually melt the edges of the cart.  Check the carts now and again and see if they look melted or uneven. 
took me a very long time to figure this one out--the taste is horrendous, intermittent and causes my throat to burn.
if the atty starts to dry out it also causes the burning sensation. 
Lots and lots of water (also helps flush all the tobacco chemicals out of your system)

    Dehydration is a vapers worse enemy.Glad to hear you are feeling better, and that your lungs ( after all the abuse of analogs) sound good. As for you juice may I suggest 99Vapors.com. All of their juices are 100% VG ( get away from the PG just in case that is causing any problems)and thier customer service is beyond excellent. Their shipping is very reasonable, their response time is excellent ( from Houston Texas to New Hampshire in 3 days). The flavors are excellent from single flavors (Coffee, Pomegranate, Watermelon) to complex flavors ( Bayou Blend, Shivas Tea, Raspberry Espresso Truffle). 

    Sorry I seem to have rambled on about them, I almost sound like a salesman.... In short great flavors, great company.",

And, like all of you, I can't help but recognize the benefits of vaping over analogs. I just have to read the countless testimonials to see that vaping has helped a lot of people feel healthier. The things people say abouthow much better they feel leads me to the conclusion that it's almost as good, if not as good, as quiting all together. But there are still some things about vaping that we should all consider. Mainly, that most of us are still addicted tonicotine. Andnicotine does have documented negative effects on our bodies.Is vaping as bad as smoking regularcigarettes? Not even close,in my opinion. Can it cause problems for usin some cases? Definately! Forinstance, a pregnant, or nursing woman should notingestnicotine in any way whatsoever.Nicotine itself has been proven to cause many harmful effects to an unborn fetus, such as low birth weight, pulmonary, vascular, and neurological problems, and it has been linked to suddeninfant dealth syndrome. Any supplier of ecigarettes should make it clear to thier customers that vapingnicotine is NOT an acceptable alternative to analogs for pregnant and nursing mothers. Ok, So what about the rest of us. Well, I'm still doing a lot of searching to find the answers I need, and I would really like to see some serious replies and links to anyinformation we may find.Nicotine doesin fact produce nitrosamines, which have been linked to many types of gastro-intestinal cancers, but the juryis still out onhow much of these nitrosamines can hurt us andhow much is presentin vaping. Each brand of analogis different, but generally speakingone analog can contain between 1-3mg ofnicotine.However, through the process of smoking, a person onlyingests about .05-.15mg per drag, depending on the depth of drag they tend to take. Most important to understandis that the half life ofnicotine is very short; only about 40 minutes. As mass producedcigarettes became popular, tobacco companies realized that packagingcigarettesin packs of 20-25 was perfect for a days worth of smoking. Just enoughnicotine to keep a guy coming back each day for a fresh pack. Did you know that if you took a drug test after only 1-2hrs of abstinence, the test would not be able to detect anynicotine in your body? A lethal dose ofnicotine for an average adult manis about 60mg. Buthow do you get thatmuch nicotine into your system by smoking or vaping? With it's short half life, a guy would have to do an awful lot of vapingin a very short amount of time to overdose onnicotine. And he would feel pretty terrible (nausea, vomitting, headaches, tachycardia, dyspnea, convulsions, and coma, before even getting to the death part. I mean,how many news reports do you hear about people being found dead fromnicotine poisoning? I suppose if you drank a bottle of juice containing 36mg/ml you could do some serious damage, whichis why itis extremely important to keep this stuff away from kids. Hell, even a small amount to a childis highly toxic, if not extremely fatal. So what do I think? I think we all need to be as educated as we can be about what we putinto our bodies and what we expose our youngones to. Keepin mind at all times that a bottle of eliquid can be worse than a loaded gun around a curious toddler. If we all act responsibly and take ownership of our actions, we can all show the world that vaping can be safe, and far more healthy than analogs. I just wish that the FDA was moreinterestedin regulating our actual welfare than they seem to be about helping out lobbyists and specialinterest groups. After all, they have the means of answering all our questions, don't they?",

I don't see it as something that MAY influence her to take up on smoking when she's older...but I think she knows better. It's actually kinda cute when I see her running after me with one of my juices in her hands and calling me, letting me know I left them behind.

Keep up the good work, it only gets better the longer you go. If the vanilla is a little sweet for you you might try mixing it with a little of the 555 and see what you think of it. Also, if you are going to go for the 0 nic it would really be cheaper for you to get some O nic mixing juice and a few bottles of different flavors you want to try and mix your own. It really does come out cheaper in the long run and you can mix and match any flavor you want.
So good luck and keep up the good fight.

I ended up catching a very bad cold 3 weeks ago and i was thinking the same thing the first few days. I had all the same symptoms, coughing, stuffiness, Turns out it was just a cold. Best thing to do is drink some hot tea, maybe cut back on the vaping a little and throw a snus pouch in or something lol. Just give your lungs a break. I have yet to cough up anything from my lungs, but i think i accomplished my lung cleaning when i had that cold/ flu whatever it was. Sounds to me like you are ok! Perfectly normal other than the common cold  

(To save my behind) If your symptoms get worse, please go see a doctor

Hopeing you are feeling better.

Since your post I have talked with 3-4 people who get migraines and what an education I got.  Apparently there are tons of triggers,  the one that stands out the most is stress then combined with something else.  Something else seems to be foods and smells and light and sounds but everyone is different!!  Wow!! overwhelming information.  Good luck finding your trigger, and take care of yourself.


Oh yes there are a zillion triggers, and then there's a root cause which folks may or may not ever figure out. 

However, I've had back muscle type problems for nearly a year.  From what I've been reading, it could actually ALSO be causing these migraine episodes.  The trigger can still be light ...etc... but the root cause could be the pinched nerve I've been dealing with forever.

Usually it gives me a stiff neck, or I get the oh so nice arm going numb when putting it in certain positions, etc.  

I might have to break down and go see the chiropractor.  I generally don't like going because their aim always seems to be to keep you coming back forever.  But sometimes an adjustment or two CAN help.  

I've been putting it off too long.  At the very least I get the old problem looked at and rule it out as the root of these brand spanking new migraines.

Shipments have been detained or delayed, but eventually they get through. The products are not currently illegal. Some states/cities have looked at bans, but again they are still legal. 
 I also read that the e cig has not been properly tested by the FDA. These things have raised some red flags for me. If this product is so safe then why not hand it over for testing? They have been handed over for testing, but the FDA chose to test only a small sample of product. The only chemical they found that is remotely harmful was diacylglycerol.  Even then, they only found a trace amount in one of the samples.  Diacylglycerol is also found in many common food products, and found in larger quantities in cigarettes. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diglyceride. 
 I know that cigarettes are bad for me and that they have a lot of chemicals that the e cig is claiming not to, but my problem is that no one really knows anything about the e cig. Your right, we don't have extensive testing on this product, but there is no way they are more harmful than cigarettes.  You can look up the ingredients in the liquids - glycerine, flavoring (mostly food), nicotine.  Somebody here may have a site that lists the ingredients.  Totally Wicked has done an independent analysis of their liquids and posted the report on their forum. This day and age, even breathing has its risks.  There have been numerous things that have been sold to the american public that was later discovered to be harmful, after FDA testing. i.e. Fin-Fin. Phen-Phen is actually still in use and was only a problem for a select few of the thousands using the product, and in many cases, the product was not being used properly.  There are those that can react to any medication, including tylenol (resulting in death).  All I am saying is that maybe proper testing should be completed before it is sold and passed off to the public as the safest cigarette possible. In the last year I have been using electronic cigarettes-- I can smell and taste better, I am no longer short of breath, The swelling in my legs has gone, I no longer cough, and my sinus infections have improved.  I know that is just me, but you can read many such testimonials.  I am not saying that it is safe or not safe, but I do understand that not everything is known about it and should be researched further. There is no such thing as safe in this day and age, like I said--breathing has its risks.  Much of the food and drink we consume has been chemically altered and enhanced. The Chemicals contained in the electronic cigarette liquids is the same stuff we consume regularly in the foods we eat and drink.  If there are any other facts that I should be aware of please let me know because I am still on the fence. Ultimately you will have to make this choice.  I really, really don't want the government telling me what I can and can't do.  The FDA is not a reliable source for testing or unbiased information.  You can guarantee the cigarette companies and pharmaceutical companies do not want this product--the loss in revenue will be huge.
What I know for for certain is that I feel better--even my husband has stopped coughing.  The chemicals and addictive additives in cigarettes are far more harmful and destructive. 
Keep researching.......
I would recommend electronic cigarettes to anybody looking at leaving cigarettes behind, but I always ask that they research and make their own decisions. 


Hope this has helped a little.",

There are many, many reasons for spine failure or success.  you just need to focus on those things that will make you a success. 
Pain control is usually our hardest problem with spine patients due to the large volumes of pain meds they take daily-- by cutting that back (if you can) it will help after surgery.  I see way more success with spine surgery than failure.  

Those with a positive attitude definitely seem to get better faster.  
The first thing I tell all my patients when they wake up--- Its going to hurt like a B**** to move, but moving is the only way you will get out of here. The more you move the quicker the pain gets better.

Been having pains in my chest, and tightening, shortness of breath and chronic fatigue.  Not severe pain, but definately noticable.  Also flutters in my heart (don't know of any other way to describe it) and sometimes rapid heart beat.  This is something I've experienced for a few years, but it usually comes and goes.  Over the past few months it's gotten worse.  Since I was a smoker and since my dad had a heart attack when he was only 54, she didn't feel comfortable with just ordering a stress test.  She said stress test are only about 75% accurate and she wanted to make sure I didn't fall through the cracks.  She said that between now an my appointment, if I have any pain that doesn't subside, get my butt to the ER.  

Snow?  We're suppose to get a big snow storm starting Friday (last time I check).

PG - breaks down into Lactic Acid. This is one of the reasons it drys out the throat, irritating it, and can make you feel slightly achy the next day as if you had worked out.

Now with those issues out of the way,  vaping, if continuously is still putting an irritating foreign material (vapor) into your throat on a consistent basis, you'll find the coughing stops coming from the lungs like with smoking, but instead issues from the throat.   

You can try VG and that should help some, and then drink water when you vape to keep your throat moist.  Other than that, eventually your body should become accustomed to the vaping like it did with smoking.",

I guess I can appreciate the notion that I may be coming down with a cold, but I must say that the last 22 years of being a Registered Nurse, coupled with 43 years of life and countless colds during that time, causes me to think that it has more to do with my past tobacco abuse than it does with any viruses.... 

My purpose for starting this topic was to bring to light the changes that people may feel when they stop smoking. I have talked with several patients, friends, and colleagues about the changes a body goes through when they quit but have sadly never experienced them myself. It is a well known fact that many people go through a phase of productive coughing and changes in they're olfactory senses. Other people have reported symptoms ranging from difficulty sleeping to migraine headaches and even soreness in they're joints and muscles. My mother quit smoking last year, and she tells me that she has never had any symptoms at all. I guess some do, and some don't.

My hope was to have other vapers include personal changes that they may have felt. My thinking is that other people new to vaping may experience changes that they may incorrectly attribute to vaping, and not to quiting tobacco. My fear is that these normal effects may cause them to stop vaping and return to analogs thinking that the ecigarette caused the problem.",

I get it also, but I wear a full upper denture plate. I found that drinking and swishing like mouth wash with Walmart ""Clear American Golden Peach""(I hope nobody in Colorado Springs reads this as it sells out fast enough already  )cleans it well enough.
Still have to spit like I have post nasal drip, but it is way better than what I used to hack up from the lungs.
I know,   EWWWW, GROSS!!!!
But true.
Hope this helps.

How awful for you.     Glad you're feeling better now.  
  Thanks for the heads up on the carts!  I guess I've been lucky in that respect, as I hate hate hate stickiness.  Can't even stand to touch a syrup bottle let alone use it.  So, I have those alcohol based hand wipes handy at all times to wash off the cart.  (however, I do intend to use the same one all day... hmmmm).  Also, now that I have a stainless steel T-tip I feel safer once again.  The stickiness will crust on it... I absolutely have to wash it off with hot water and a paper towel a few times a day.  (will be more often in the summer I'm sure).  I even set it into boiled water and swirl it around at least once a day.  (to get rid of the inside buildup).  I think I better order a few extras for those times I won't be able to wash at leisure.  (travelling, etc).  

Glad you're feeling better and back on the forum!  Was wondering where you were, have missed your posts!",

As I mentioned in another thread there are ingredients on TW liquids on the bottle.  I don't know what they are and havn't looked them up but my brother said he worked with one of those and they are ""bad"".  Also how about supliers in USA who claim 100 American Juice from American sources. It's funny how they run out of stock (juice)after the Chinese new year. What ingredients could they posibly be waiting for? Does it come from USA or doesn't it?


Looks like we've got ourselves a smart member! I've been saying this for a while, I call BS on most ""American Made"" E Liquid. I believe most of it is mixed. In fact some of the american made E Liquid have flavors very similar to that of which Lor Ann oils sells. In fact you can go down the list of flavors and match them up. 

I think what most are doing is ordering the unflavored liquid from China, mixing it here in the states and selling it as American Made. One of these days it's going to back fire on them and I'm glad we have members who are starting to catch on. (I would like to mention that I believe Johnsons Creek and Vermont Vapor is in fact created in the states, however the rest I would use caution with)

And currently buying a bottle of nicotine just isn't going to happen without having some serious licensing. You can however purchase nicotine has a pesticide and break it down, but boy you better know what your doing...I'd rather stick with China.",

I remember that DEG thing when the FDA ""study"" came out... trace amounts found in ONE cartridge out of several. This strikes me as a simple case of insufficient quality control. The Chinese are very clever, but not known for being all that fussy when manufacturing products.

While I think Johnson Creek could stand to bump up the intensity of their flavorings, one thing about them is that they ARE fussy when it comes to making juice. The FDA has inspected their facility and signed off on the sanitary aspect of it, though not on the juice itself, obviously. Juice outta China has to be a little suspect, I think.",

PG - breaks down into Lactic Acid. This is one of the reasons it drys out the throat, irritating it, and can make you feel slightly achy the next day as if you had worked out.

Now with those issues out of the way,  vaping, if continuously is still putting an irritating foreign material (vapor) into your throat on a consistent basis, you'll find the coughing stops coming from the lungs like with smoking, but instead issues from the throat.   

You can try VG and that should help some, and then drink water when you vape to keep your throat moist.  Other than that, eventually your body should become accustomed to the vaping like it did with smoking.

Thanks Highly for this post I have been reading on how Vg can raise glucose levels and in being a diabetic this is something I will have to learn to monitor in my daily intake of along with foods,however it still doesn't beat being able to walk away from analogs and possibly getting some health issues back under control.",

Glad to hear you're doing better, TeriJo.  And I really and truly hope it is not the vaping causing you problems.  Of course you'll still need to take care of whatever it is that is causing the problem, i.e. the pinched nerve.  Doesn't sound like a lot of fun, but then I'm one who will not go to the doctor without throwing a huge fit, so I might not be the one to talk here.  LOL

You take care and don't be a stranger.  Even if you have to wear the sunglasses to stay in touch.   


Yeah, not the fastest person to run to the doctor.  I did find some stretches that should help.  I just know that most of the time when I go to the doc for a pinched nerve, they don't actually DO anything.  They give you pain killers and anti inflammatories and charge ya big bucks, and your body actually fixes itself.

However, in this case I may have to get off my high horse and go see about it because it's lasted longer than they usually do. 

Keep smiling and stuff!!!!",

If I understand it correctly, the same properties that allow it to absorb the nicotine and flavoring is the same properties that strip the moisture off your lips, mouth, and throat. To solve the lip problem you use medicated chap stick. To solve the mouth problem you just drink. To solve the throat problem you have to gargle your drink. Gargling breaks off the layer of PG on your throat. Also, having a humidifier in your room helps all three. Earlier today I had a bad sore throat. I had to get rid of it. With my chronic bronchitis, once my throat gets really sore I cough to the point that I'm suffering and if I go to sleep with a sore throat I'll wake up choking on phlegm. I still have this prescription cough medicine that has codeine in it that I got when I had H1N1. It saved me the other day. Without it I would of been in the emergency room. I could not stop coughing enough to even get air and I think it was because of the PG plus this dry winter air. Anyway, when I had my bad sore throat earlier today I decided to try the gargling method that I believe I read on this forum somewhere. I drank a can of Sprite. Every gulp I gargled as long as I could until I had to breathe. In about 15 minutes the sore throat went away. If I didn't do that I'd probably be taking a sick day tomorrow.",
