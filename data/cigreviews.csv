I was a pack-a-day smoker (semi-serious), and I enjoyed the experience. The burn, the oral fixation, the social factor, the pleasant head buzz--basically the overall calming effect it had on me after a hard day's work. And when I wasn't at work, I smoked while watching TV, reading, browsing the Internet, etc. Smoking added more pleasure to the activities I already enjoyed. But I knew smoking was killing me.
 

It was about two months after my girlfriend bought me the electronic cigarette that I tried it for the first time--mind you, I had to brush off some dust from the box because I had buried in a drawer. To my surprise the electronic cigarette was enjoyable, as close as one could get to the real thing. I was still able to blow rings (albeit vapor rings); the oral fixation was satisfied; and the edge that I often felt when trying to quit was 95% gone. It took some time to use to, but I could hardly believe it when I went one full week without a real cigarette. That was three months ago. I don't feel agitated from lack of nicotine, because the electronic cigarette is a nicotine supplement. It just doesn't kill you, like the way cigarettes do. My lungs are free from the thousands of carcinogenic pollutants that are in real cigarettes, and I feel healthier. Also, two of my close friends tried my electronic cigarette and loved it. They bought their own, and now we sit around indoors and smoke, all without slowly killing ourselves.",""

Some of them I have tried  

cigarette look-alike

Eversmoke (US) - elegant with its crystal tip, solid vapor and flavor for a little e-cig, but it's not 20 cigs equivalent - it's 10 at best. Now I heard they introduced stronger flavor (24mg) beside the usual ones (0-6-12-18mg) 
 

Smoker's Angel (UK) - excellent e-liquid. Tobacco flavor with a slight touch of vanilla that doesn't stand in the way of solid throat hit. Good things about their starter kit is that they usually give two cartomizers (cartridges) strengths - 12 and 18 mg  in one kit, i.e. two bottles of liquid in these same levels with their eGo kits.  Also the claims that one cartomizer (cartridge) is equivalent to 30 cigs are exaggerated. It's 15 at best. 
 

For me it's not necessary for e-cigarette to physically resemble  good old tobacco cig - I'm not a visual type, I suppose. So I go for eGo types for several reasons
 

-endlessly customizable. You can really customize everything (choose battery, choose cartomizers/clearomizers, choose e-liquid and don't have to buy everything from the same retailer if you don't want to). For me, eGo-T and eGo-VV are quite enough, but I have ordered eGo-VV from Apollo (3.0-6.0 volts) for my husband.  
 

-pretty popular, so you have spare parts practically everywhere. I've bought it from Croatia, UK, China, US and they fit together as long as that is 510 thread.  
 

-this thing really drastically cuts your smoking (pardon me, vaping) costs. I can safely say that I spend 3 times less with eGo vaping than with tobacco cigarettes. 
 

Now had I gone with cig look-alikes or with APVs (advanced personal vaporizers liek Provari) these costs wouldn't have been so low. They would still be less than with tobacco cigs.  Unless you are an enthusiast changing his/her APVs like socks. (It can be an interesting hobby, I admit).",""

Then moved to a Joye 510 which was a lot better.  Decided to get a modded unit and went with the Silver Bullet, and that is my main PV when I actually decide to vape.  Not very good with the habit.    Yeah, I got burned by Blu too. The only thing I can compare it to is smoking a broken cigarette. I used Crown 7s for awhile went to the 510 tank style. It was better but inconsistent. I recently discovered ""dripping"" and the SP3. I do have to admit that Blu uses some awesome juice (Johnson Creek), but too bad their e-cig totally sucks. You can buy Johnson Creek from the JC site, but I advise buying their VG blend. The PG doesn't vape as well and it gives you serious cotton mouth.",""
